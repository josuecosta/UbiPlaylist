# UbiPlaylist
Challenge proposed by the company

# What is it?
API should work with Users, Tracks, and a list of tracks by users (Playlists)

# Results
Results looks like an html template and part of API REST developed with django. 

# What is missing? (A lot...)
- The website should interact with API REST (maybe with AngularJS)
- The fields in this brackets "[]" should correspond to a real data in database.
- Buttons don't work
- Initial data for the songs must originate from a json file by implementing a json parse.
